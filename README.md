# SwitchKeyboard Script

This small PowerShell script allows you to quickly change the Keyboard Manager configuration in PowerToys when switching between different keyboards for HomeOffice and Office setups.


## Overview

- **Default Configuration:** The script uses your HomeOffice setup as the default configuration (no changes needed).
- **Office Configuration:** For the Office, a different keyboard mapping can be applied.

The included configuration files are examples that I use personally, but they can be customized to fit your needs.


## Installation Instructions

1. **Copy the Script:**
   Copy the `SwitchKeyboard` file to the following path:
   
   C:\Users%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs
   This allows the script to be easily accessed from the Start Menu.


3. **Pin to Start Menu:**
- Open the Start Menu.
- Search for "SwitchKeyboard".
- Right-click on it and select "Pin to Start".


Now, you can easily switch between your keyboard configurations directly from the Start Menu.

Feel free to customize the script and configuration files according to your specific setup!
